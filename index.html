<h2>CSS's role in web development</h2>
<hr>
<p>CSS was the upgrade that HTML didnt know it needed, adding the ability to be more strict on how things look, colors, sizes and alignments. CSS created a more fine grain detail to web development that was not avaliable before, the ablity for the user to change the way that they design their sites on a fine tuned level, created a revolution of UI/UX development, and made it possible for the developers thing more about the user experience, and develop a better environment for the user.</p>

      <li>H1 font-size is 2em, font-weight is bold.</li>
